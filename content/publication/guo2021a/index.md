abstract= "Transmission line failures in power systems propagate non-locally, making the control of the resulting outages extremely difficult. In this work, we establish a mathematical theory that characterizes the patterns of line failure propagation and localization in terms of network graph structure. It provides a novel perspective on distribution factors that precisely captures Kirchhoff's Law in terms of topological structures. Our results show that the distribution of specific collections of subtrees of the transmission network plays a critical role on the patterns of power redistribution, and motivates the block decomposition of the transmission network as a structure to understand long-distance propagation of disturbances. In Part I of this paper, we present the case when the post-contingency network remains connected after an initial set of lines are disconnected simultaneously. In Part II, we present the case when an outage separates the network into multiple islands."
summary = "How does the network topology affect failure propagation in power systems? Here's a comprehensive theory in two parts!"
