abstract= "We consider the hard-core model with Metropolis transition probabilities on finite grid graphs and investigate the asymptotic behavior of the first hitting time between its two maximum-occupancy configurations in the low-temperature regime. In particular, we show how the order-of-magnitude of this first hitting time depends on the grid sizes and on the boundary conditions by means of a novel combinatorial method. Our analysis also proves the asymptotic exponentiality of the scaled hitting time and yields the mixing time of the process in the low-temperature limit as side-result. In order to derive these results, we extended the model-independent framework in [(Manzo et al. 2004)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:JOSS.0000019822.45867.ec) for first hitting times to allow for a more general initial state and target subset."
summary = "How to expand the metastability theory to the case of multiple stable equilibria and how to apply to the finite-volume hard-core model?"
