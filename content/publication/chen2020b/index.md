abstract= "This work proposes an approach for failure mitigation in power systems via corrective control named Optimal Injection Adjustment (OIA). In contrast to classical approaches, which focus on minimizing load loss, OIA aims to minimize the post-contingency ï¬‚ow deviations by adjusting node power injections in response to failures. We prove that the optimal control actions obtained from OIA are localized around the original failure. Specifically, at any given node an injection adjustment is not required unless at least one of its neighboring nodes closer to the failure already reached its adjustment limit. Numerical simulations highlight that OIA achieves near-optimal control costs despite using localized control actions."
summary = "Is it possible to react only locally yet efficiently to line failures in power systems?"
