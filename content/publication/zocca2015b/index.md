abstract= "We consider dense wireless random-access networks, modeled as systems of particles with hardcore interaction. The particles represent the network users that try to become active after an exponential back-off time, and stay active for an exponential transmission time. Due to wireless interference, active users prevent other nearby users from simultaneous activity, which we describe as hardcore interaction on a conflict graph. We show that dense networks with aggressive back-off schemes lead to extremely slow transitions between dominant states, and inevitably cause long mixing times and starvation effects."
