abstract= "We present the Basin Hopping with Skipping (BH-S) algorithm for stochastic optimisation, which replaces the perturbation step of basin hopping (BH) with a so-called skipping proposal from the rare-event sampling literature. Empirical results on benchmark optimisation surfaces demonstrate that BH-S can improve performance relative to BH by encouraging non-local exploration, that is, by hopping between distant basins."
