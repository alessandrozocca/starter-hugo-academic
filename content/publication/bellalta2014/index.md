abstract= "This book chapter introduces the use of Continuous-Time Markov Networks (CTMN) to analytically capture the operation of Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) networks. It is of tutorial nature, and it aims to be an introduction on this topic, providing a clear and easy-to-follow description. To illustrate how CTMN can be used, we introduce a set of representative and cutting-edge scenarios, such as Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), Power Line Communication networks and multiple overlapping Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). For each scenario, we describe the specific CTMN, obtain its stationary distribution and compute the throughput achieved by each node in the network. Taking the per-node throughput as reference, we discuss how the complex interactions between nodes using CSMA/CA have an impact on system performance."
