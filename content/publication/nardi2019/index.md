abstract= "We consider the ferromagnetic q-state Potts model with zero external field in a finite volume and assume that the stochastic evolution of this system is described by a Glauber-type dynamics parametrized by the inverse temperature ${\\beta}$. Our analysis concerns the low-temperature regime ${\\beta \\to \\infty}$, in which this multi-spin system has ${q}$ stable equilibria, corresponding to the configurations where all spins are equal. Focusing on grid graphs with various boundary conditions, we study the tunneling phenomena of the ${q}$-state Potts model. More specifically, we describe the asymptotic behavior of the first hitting times between stable equilibria as ${\\beta \\to \\infty}$ in probability, in expectation, and in distribution and obtain tight bounds on the mixing time as side-result. In the special case ${q=2}$, our results characterize the tunneling behavior of the Ising model on grid graphs."
summary = "How does this interacting particle system with multiple equilibria behave in the low-temperature limit?"
