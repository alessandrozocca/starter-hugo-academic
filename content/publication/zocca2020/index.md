abstract= "Motivated by developments in renewable energy and smart grids, we formulate a stylized mathematical model of a transport network with stochastic load fluctuations. Using an affine control rule, we explore the trade-off between the number of controllable resources in a lossy transport network and the performance gain they yield in terms of expected power losses. Our results are explicit and reveal the interaction between the level of flexibility, the intrinsic load uncertainty and the network structure."
