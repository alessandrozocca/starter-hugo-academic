abstract= "Transmission power systems usually consist of interconnected sub-grids that are operated relatively independently. When a failure happens, it is desirable to localize its impact within the sub-grid where the failure occurs. This paper introduces three interface networks to connect sub-grids, achieving better failure localization  while maintaining robust network connectivity. The proposed interface networks are validated with numerical experiments on the IEEE 118-bus test network under both DC and AC power flow models."
summary = "Which interface subnetwork are best to connect sub-grids aiming to improve their robustness?"
